# Hye
Frontend: [https://shopping-hye.github.io](https://shopping-hye.github.io).

Backend: [https://j3uvhhijq0.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api/hye](https://j3uvhhijq0.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api/hye).

### Key Points
1. When user opens the page, they should see a randomized view based on the `product` and `price` match.
2. The user activity is tracked from the retention period in each UI section.
3. When checkout, the user should obtain a testing ID (it can be formed using the view version).

### Backend Data Structure
Coming soon!
